# Welcome to the `Book Club Code` site!

This is a place for the Embedded.fm book club to collaborate and learn together.

## Repo Structure Guide

### Top-level folders currently include:
* **[Books](https://github.com/cadet702/Embedded-STM32/tree/main/Books)** - For code directly related to chapters and exercises in the books we read.
* **[Playground](https://github.com/cadet702/Embedded-STM32/tree/main/Playground)** - For individuals to create their own subfolders for whatever they want.
* **[Tools](https://github.com/cadet702/Embedded-STM32/tree/main/Tools)** - For sharing and iterating on general purpose code, drivers, and tools.


## Contributing to Book Club Code

There are two main options for contributing to this repo: issues and pull requests.

### Issues

A GitHub **[Issue](https://github.com/cadet702/Embedded-STM32/issues)** is a ticket you create that logs a specific problem, a bug, a feature request, or an inquiry. This issue will be logged centrally and responded to by other people in this community.

> _**Issues are ideal when you see something which can be improved but there isn't an obvious fix.**_

### Pull Requests

A GitHub **[Pull Request](https://github.com/cadet702/Embedded-STM32/pulls)** ("PR") is a request for the site maintainers to _pull in_ changes that have been authored by other users.

> _**PRs are ideal when you already know how to improve the site and want to propose a set of specific changes.**_
